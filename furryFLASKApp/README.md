    Furry Friends Dog and Cat Shelter Web App is a database driven website that stores information about the dogs and cats, such as age, breed, health information (date of vaccinated, neutered, microchipped), and helps find their new homes. All information is accurately maintained, and so that the shelter can run more smoothly. 

    The database design had been implemented with multiple steps, normalized and restructured the Schema over the course of project. Flask Python technology is used as backend implementation. Each entity has its own page, and most entities have CRUD operation and dynamic dropdown functionality on the web application.
